      When enabled, debug entries will be sent to the Message Queue any time (with few exceptions) they would be sent to Player.log.
      At higher levels of verbosity, this can be {{r|very}} "loud" and spammy.

      3 Modifiers is surprisingly well balanced, so the addition of a 4th needs to be at a significant cost to remain balanced, however balance is often subjective.
      
      Activity accumulated by &quot;held together by {{utilitape|utilitape}}&quot; each turn will be multiplied by this option's setting before being tested as odds against a chance in 10,000 that a jostled item will take damage.

      During each turn, a number of different actions that can be taken by the item itself or its holder will tell &quot;held together by {{utilitape|utilitape}}&quot; to accumulate activity of varying amounts (but typically only once per action per turn).

      An item idly drawing charge adds {{G|5}} activity (extremely passive).

      An equipped Body slot Armor when attacked (whether hit or not) adds {{R|625}} activity (extremely active).

      If the combined amount of activity in a turn is {{G|0}}, then the item is {{G|completely safe}}.

      If the amount of activity {{R|exceeds 10,000}} in a turn, then {{R|damage is guaranteed}}.

      The {{r|higher}} this option is set, the {{r|more likely}} an item is to {{r|take damage}} each turn it's involved in activity.

      The default is {{W|1}}.

        Default="No" >
    <helptext>
      When enabled, &quot;held together by {{utilitape|utilitape}}&quot; can be applied to otherwise eligable items irrespective of how many mods they already have applied.

      The default behaviour is that the mod can only be applied to items that already have the maximum number of mods.

      This is largely because the destructive nature of the mod combined with the fact that its only benefit comes when already maxed out on mods means it's typically a poor decision to apply it before wanting to apply a fourth mod.

      The default is {{w|Disabled}}.

    <helptext>
      When enabled, &quot;held together by {{utilitape|utilitape}}&quot; will take into account how many mods are currently applied to an item when determining how likely the item will be damaged while being used.
      
      Excluding utilitape, the following schedule lays out the adjustment to damage chance:
      {{G|0}}: won't be damaged.
      {{g|1}}: 1/4 as likely
      {{W|2}}: 1/3 as likely
      {{r|3}}: 1/2 as likely
      {{R|4}}: 1/1 as likely (capped)

      The default is {{w|Disabled}}.
